Problem: Is it possible to advance from the start of the array to the last element given that the maximum you can
advance from a position is based on the value of the array at the index you are currently present on?
 
i > max_furute_index: This implies that the end is not reachable.
max_furute_index >= last_idx : This implies that the end is reachable.

In each iteration of the while loop, we update max_furute_index to the maximum of max_furute_index and (A[i] + i) . 
i increments by 1 in the next line.

After the while loop terminates, weâ€™ll check for the condition which terminates the while loop. 
If max_furute_index >= last_idx, then True is returned from the function. Otherwise, False is returned.

            max_future_idx = max(max_future_idx, A[i] + i)
