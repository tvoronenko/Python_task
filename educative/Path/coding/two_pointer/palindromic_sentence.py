'''
Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphabetic characters and ignoring case. Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation) should be ignored.


Example 1:
Input: s = "Bob wondered, 'Now, Bob?'"
Output: true
Explanation: Considering only letters and ignoring case, we get
"bobwonderednowbob" which is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: Considering only letters and ignoring case, we get "raceacar"
which is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: Considering only letters and ignoring case, we get
"amanaplanacanalpanama" which is a palindrome.
Constraints:

0 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5
s consists of printable ASCII characters
